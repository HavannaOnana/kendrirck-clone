# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

While this project uses React, Vite supports many popular JS frameworks. [See all the supported frameworks](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Vite project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/vite-react&template=vite-react)

_Live Example: https://vite-react-example.vercel.app_

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Vite project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):

```shell
$ vercel
```
